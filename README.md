# Break Tools

An app for the bboys and bgirls.

It allows for you to have a move book with classifications/names/values. This way you can organize your moves and combos. There are also several tools built into the site based off of practice games I've picked up. Right now there are 3 tools.

30/30 - This is essentially a stop watch that plays an airhorn every 30 seconds. It's useful for developing endurance. Practice hard for 30 seconds, then rest for 30 seconds.

Battle Mode - This shows all of your moves in their different categories. Swipe a move and select it as 'used'. It's then hidden. If you select all of the moves you did in a given round, the ones remaining are the moves you have left. By the time you get to the finals of a jam, you have a list of the moves you have left.
